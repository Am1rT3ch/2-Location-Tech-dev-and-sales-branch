  Central routing setup to enable communication between VLANs.

- **DHCP Server**  
  Dynamic IP allocation to all wired devices based on VLAN.

- **Wireless Access Point (WAP)**  
  Configured internet access to customers and workers.
  
- **OSPF (Dynamic Routing)**
Enables automatic route exchange between sites with fast convergence and efficient path selection.

- **Access Control Lists (ACLs)**  
  Network-level policies to restrict guest access to sensitive segments.

- **Ping Tests**  
  Used to validate inter-VLAN connectivity and troubleshoot issues.
