# 🏪 Tech Sales Branch with WiFi

A hybrid wired and wireless network for a simulated tech sales store, built using Cisco Packet Tracer as part of my CCNA-level hands-on training.

## 📋 Project Overview

This project simulates the IT infrastructure of a small retail tech branch. It combines VLAN-based segmentation with secure wireless access, designed to support both employees and visiting customers while maintaining a secure and manageable network.

## 🔧 Features

- **VLAN Segmentation**  
  Dedicated VLANs for staff and guests for network isolation and improved security.

- **Router-on-a-Stick (ROAS)**  
  Central routing setup to enable communication between VLANs.

- **DHCP Server**  
  Dynamic IP allocation to all wired devices based on VLAN.

- **Wireless Access Point (WAP)**  
  Configured with **WPA2** security to provide internet access to customers.

- **SSH Remote Access**  
  Secure access to the network infrastructure for administrators.

- **Access Control Lists (ACLs)**  
  Network-level policies to restrict guest access to sensitive segments.

- **Ping Tests**  
  Used to validate inter-VLAN connectivity and troubleshoot issues.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
